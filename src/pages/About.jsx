              I am a Developer and Designer based in Pune, India 🌍. I have
              always been fascinated by Knowledge 🧠 and learning new things.
              Throughout my life, I have spoken, read and written in English
              fluently. Currently, I'm exploring Restful API's 👩🏾‍💻 as part of my
              skillset. When not working on projects or spending time with
              family or friends, you can usually find me watching YouTube videos
              💻 or listening to music 🎧. As an experienced Web developer who
              is skilled in many areas of development 😎 (responsive design
              being one),I would love to work with businesses both small and
              large!
